          <h1>Thirteenth Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO 13)</h1>
          <div id="location">London, UK</div>
          <div id="dates">24-25 April, 2025</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The <i>Symposium on Compositional Structures</i> is a series of
        interdisciplinary meetings aiming to support the growing community of
        researchers interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both
        applied and abstract perspectives, and in particular where category
        theory serves as a unifying common language. We welcome submissions from
        researchers across computer science, mathematics, physics, philosophy,
        and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly discussion, disseminating
        new ideas, and spreading knowledge between fields. Submission is
        encouraged for both mature research and work in progress, and by both
        established academics and junior researchers, including students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions.
        The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if
        it has been submitted or published elsewhere. You could submit
        work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or even a PhD or
        Masters thesis.
      </p>
      <p>
        While no list of topics could be exhaustive, <i>SYCO</i> welcomes
        submissions with a compositional focus related to any of the following
        areas, in particular from the perspective of category theory:

                Partial Markov categories are a synthetic theory of stochastic processes with constraints, observations and updates. They unify the perspective of Markov categories on stochastic processes with that of cartesian restriction categories on partial processes. I will give an overview of these structures and show how they relate to each other. The structure of partial Markov categories allows bayesian reasoning: it gives a synthetic Bayes theorem.

                In the field of categorical probability, one uses concepts and techniques from category theory, such as monads and monoidal categories, to study the structures of probability and statistics. In this paper, we connect some ideas from categorical algebra, namely weakly cartesian functors and natural transformations, to the idea of conditioning in probability theory, using Markov categories and probability monads. First of all, we show that under some conditions, the monad associated to a Markov category with conditionals has a weakly cartesian functor and weakly cartesian multiplication (a condition known as Beck-Chevalley, or BC). In particular, we show that this is the case for the Giry monad on standard Borel spaces. We then connect this theory to existing results on statistical experiments. We show that for deterministic statistical experiments, the so-called standard measure construction (which can be seen as a generalization of the "hyper-normalizations" introduced by Jacobs) satisfies a universal property, allowing an equivalent definition which does not rely on the existence of conditionals.

                While the ZX and ZW calculi have been effective as graphical reasoning tools for finite-dimensional quantum computation, the possibilities for continuous-variable quantum computation (CVQC) in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space are only beginning to be explored. In this work, we formulate a graphical language for CVQC. Each diagram is an undirected graph made of two types of spiders: the Z spider from the ZX calculus defined on the reals, and the newly introduced Fock spider defined on the natural numbers. The Z and X spiders represent functions in position and momentum space respectively, while the Fock spider represents functions in the discrete Fock basis. In addition to the Fourier transform between Z and X, and the Hermite transform between Z and Fock, we present exciting new graphical rules capturing heftier CVQC interactions.
We ensure this calculus is complete for all of Gaussian CVQC interpreted in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, by translating the completeness in affine Lagrangian relations by Booth, Carette, and Comfort. Applying our calculus for quantum error correction, we derive graphical representations of the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code encoder, syndrome measurement, and magic state distillation of Hadamard eigenstates. Finally, we elucidate Gaussian boson sampling by providing a fully graphical proof that its circuit samples submatrix hafnians.<br />

                We investigate the semantical properties of the category of finite
dimensional operator spaces, in particular, we prove that it is a non-degenerate model of multiplicative additive linear logic. We also argue that this category gives a good basis for modeling BV-logic, an extension of multiplicative linear logic, by showing that it is a BV-category.<br />

                This talk presents a pedagogical experiment that uses Quantum Picturalism (QP)—a compositional formalism of quantum theory—to test whether quantum physics and technologies can be effectively taught to high school students. Conducted in 2023, this experiment involved students aged 16-18. 54 randomly selected students from the UK attended two-hour online classes and tutorials weekly for eight weeks, and were then assessed using Oxford postgraduate quantum physics exam questions. The results showed that over 80% of the students passed, with about half earning a distinction.<br /><br />

The talk will provide an overview of our pedagogical experiment, the subsequent developments in the education and policy sectors, and the future prospects of the QP education programme. It will also include examples of QP educational material, highlighting how quantum ideas are expressed and communicated through a compositional lens. We hope this talk will showcase the merits and potential of the compositional turn in quantum physics, especially in pedagogy.<br />

                Grothendieck-Verdier categories (also known as star-autonomous categories) generalize rigid monoidal categories, with notable representation-theoretic examples including categories of bimodules, modules over Hopf algebroids, and modules over vertex operator algebras.<br /><br />
                In this paper, we develop a surface-diagrammatic calculus for Grothendieck-Verdier categories, extending the string-diagrammatic calculus of Joyal and Street for rigid monoidal categories into a third dimension. This extension naturally arises from the non-invertibility of coherence data in Grothendieck-Verdier categories. <br /><br />
                
                We show that key properties of Frobenius algebras in rigid monoidal categories carry over to the Grothendieck-Verdier setting. Moreover, we introduce higher Frobenius-Schur indicators for suitably finite k-linear pivotal Grothendieck-Verdier categories and prove their invariance under pivotal Frobenius linearly distributive equivalences.<br /><br />
                The proofs are carried out using the surface-diagrammatic calculus.<br />

                I will give an overview of the diagrammatic model of (∞,n)-categories. This is designed to share (or improve) the good features of strict higher categories—such as a strong pasting theorem enabling explicit diagrammatic reasoning, and an expressive language for cellular models—while provably satisfying the homotopy hypothesis, and hopes to function as a bridge between non-algebraic and algebraic models.<br />

                We define a naturality construction for the operations of weak omega-categories, as a meta-operation in a dependent type theory. Our construction has a geometrical motivation as a local tensor product with a directed interval, and behaves logically as a globular analogue of Reynolds parametricity. Our construction operates as a "power tool" to support construction of terms with geometrical structure, and we use it to define composition operations for cylinders and cones in omega-categories. The machinery can generate terms of high complexity, and we have implemented our construction in a proof assistant, which verifies that the generated terms have the correct type. All our results can be exported to homotopy type theory, allowing the explicit computation of complex path type inhabitants.<br />

                In this talk we discuss prior and ongoing work on categorical cryptography. We first recap the categorical framework formalizing the simulation paradigm of cryptography. An instructive example is given by the one-time pad, whose composable security follows from the axioms of an Hopf algebra with an integral in a symmetric monoidal category. We then survey ongoing work, including  (i) the search for further pictorial proofs in cryptography, based on notions defined in terms of computational indistinguishability such as pseudorandomness  and (ii) capturing (variants) of other approaches to composable security under the categorical framework.<br />

                To formalize calculations in linear algebra for the development of efficient algorithms and a framework suitable for functional programming languages and faster parallelized computations, we adopt an approach that treats elements of linear algebra, such as matrices, as morphisms in the category of matrices, Mat_k. This framework is further extended by generalizing the results to arbitrary monoidal semiadditive categories. To enrich this perspective and accommodate higher-rank matrices (tensors), we define semiadditive 2-categories, where matrices T_ij are represented as 1-morphisms, and tensors with four indices T_ijkl as 2-morphisms. This formalization provides an index-free, typed linear algebra framework that includes matrices and tensors with up to four indices. Furthermore, we extend the framework to monoidal semiadditive 2-categories and demonstrate detailed operations and vectorization within the 2-category of 2Vec introduced by Kapranov and Voevodsky.<br /><br />

If time permits, I will discuss generalisation of this work to cartesian closed bicategories.<br />

                The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual words together according to the grammatical structure of the text to be read by the model.
The compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional generalisation - the ability of a model to generalise outside its training distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data distribution - and compositional understandability - making sense of how the model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation and the processes through which they are combined.<br /><br />

                We consider how well DisCoCirc models can learn different types of compositional behaviour. We compare both quantum circuit based models, as well as classical neural networks under a series of training paradigms, on a dataset derived from one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of compositionality.<br /><br />
                Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ for the systematicity and overgeneralisation tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the Train data.<br /><br />

                Finally, we inspect the trained models, both by comparing them to manually-constructed perfect compositional models, and by considering how the model components interact with one another, explaining how the models behave and exhibiting the models' compositional understandability.<br />

                We present a compositional theory of nonlinear audio signal processing based on a categorification of the Volterra series. We begin by augmenting the classical definition of the Volterra series so that it is functorial with respect to a base category whose objects are temperate distributions and whose morphisms are certain linear transformations. This motivates the derivation of formulae describing how the outcomes of nonlinear transformations are affected if their input signals are linearly processed – e.g., translated, modulated, sampled, or periodized. We then consider how nonlinear audio systems, themselves, change, and introduce as a model thereof the notion of morphism of Volterra series, which we exhibit as both a type of lens map and natural transformation. We show how morphisms can be parameterized and used to generate indexed families (e.g., sequences) of Volterra series, which are well-suited to model nonstationary or time-varying nonlinear phenomena. We then describe how Volterra series and their morphisms organize into a category, which we call Volt. We exhibit the operations of sum, product, and series composition of Volterra series as monoidal products on Volt, and identify, for each in turn, its corresponding universal property. In particular, we show that the series composition of Volterra series is associative. We then bridge between our framework and the subject at the heart of audio signal processing: time-frequency analysis. Specifically, we show that a known equivalence, between a class of second-order Volterra series and the bilinear time-frequency distributions (TFDs), can be extended to one between certain higher-order Volterra series and the so-called polynomial TFDs. We end by outlining potential avenues for future work, including the incorporation of nonlinear system identification techniques and the potential extension of our theory to the settings of graph and topological audio signal processing.<br />

                In a previous iteration of SYCO, I explained the relationship between classifying toposes, categories of monoid actions and a classical result from model theory: that there is a Galois connection between subgroups of the group of automorphisms of a model (of a first-order theory) and "extensions" of that model.<br /><br />

In this talk I would like to present a topos-theoretic perspective on another piece of model theory, namely Fraissé theory, which provides sufficient conditions for the existence of a special "ultrahomogeneous" model of a theory to exist. This is a model that contains all finite (or finitely generated) models as submodels in a symmetric way, such as the Rado graph.<br /><br />

Usually (in work of Caramello or Kubis, say) the category-theoretic presentation of Fraisse theory again involves automorphism groups, so the main novelty of my presentation will be to show what extra flexibility moving from groups to monoids affords us in the Fraisse construction. This is based on Chapter 6 of my thesis*, which as yet has not been reworked into a published form (so is technically work in progress). <br /><br />

                Containers are used to carve out a class of strictly positive data types in terms of shapes and positions. They can be interpreted via a fully-faithful functor into endofunctors on Set. Monadic containers are an extension of containers whose interpretation as a Set functor carries a monad structure. The category of containers is closed under container composition and is a monoidal category, whereas monadic containers do not in general compose.<br /><br />

                In this paper, we develop a characterisation of distributive laws of monadic containers. Distributive laws were introduced as a sufficient condition for the composition of the underlying functors of two monads to also carry a monad structure. Our development parallels Ahman and Uustalu's characterisation of distributive laws of directed containers, i.e. containers whose Set functor interpretation carries a comonad structure. Furthermore, by combining our work with theirs, we construct characterisations of mixed distributive laws (i.e. of directed containers over monadic containers and vice versa), thereby completing the `zoo' of distributive laws from a container perspective.<br /><br />

                We have found these characterisations amenable to development of existence and uniqueness proofs of distributive laws, particularly in the mechanised setting of Cubical Agda, in which most of the theory of this paper has been formalised.<br />

                Tape diagrams provide a graphical representation for arrows of rig categories, namely categories equipped with two monoidal structures, $\oplus$ and $\otimes$, where $\otimes$ distributes over $\oplus$. However, their applicability is limited to categories where $\oplus$ is a biproduct, i.e., both a categorical product and a coproduct. In this work, we extend tape diagrams to deal with Kleisli categories of symmetric monoidal monads, presented by algebraic theories.<br />

                We present sd-visualiser, a tool for transforming programs as syntax into hierarchical hypergraphs, and rendering the output as interactive string diagrams.
In doing so, we define a toy language sd-lang for the description of such hypergraphs as programs.<br /><br />

                Many compilers use graph-based intermediate representations (IRs) of programs internally for the purposes of code generation, program analysis, and optimisation.
We show how our methods extend to real-world IRs of programs generated by the LLVM/MLIR compiler toolchain to visualise programs with varying combinations of compiler optimisations applied, providing a tool to explore these graph-based IRs which is formally grounded in categorical semantics.<br /><br />

                We implement the correspondence between our notion of hierarchical hypergraph and terms in a traced cartesian closed category, whereby connectivity of hyperedges is translated into a foliation of monoidal terms with explicit copying, deletion, and swapping.
Our approach applies computational methods for drawing string diagrams, which is more principled than existing ad-hoc GraphViz-based approaches, allowing us to effectively combine dataflow and control flow with sharing in one aesthetically pleasing picture.
Moreover, the interactive nature of our tool allows for collapsing/expanding hierarchical nodes, and iterative refinement for focusing on a particular region of interest within a large program delineated by hypergraph connectivity.<br /><br />
