ELEVENTH SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 11)

Palaiseau, France
20-21 April, 2023

Registration deadline: Monday 10 April 2023

-----------------------------------------

The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an interdisciplinary series
of meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers interested in
the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives,
and in particular where category theory serves as a unifying common
language. Previous SYCO events have been held in Birmingham, Strathclyde,
Oxford, Chapman, Leicester, Tallinn, and Como.

The program consists of 2 invited talks and 14 contributed talks. We will try to
offer the possibility of following the talks online.
