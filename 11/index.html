      The <i>Symposium on Compositional Structures</i> is a series of
      interdisciplinary meetings aiming to support the growing community of
      researchers interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both
      applied and abstract perspectives, and in particular where category theory
      serves as a unifying common language. We welcome submissions from
      researchers across computer science, mathematics, physics, philosophy, and
      beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly discussion, disseminating new
      ideas, and spreading knowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged
      for both mature research and work in progress, and by both established
      academics and junior researchers, including students.
    </p>

    <p>
      Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions. The
      meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has
      been submitted or published elsewhere. You could submit work-in-progress,
      or a recently completed paper, or even a PhD or Masters thesis.
    </p>

    <p>
      While no list of topics could be exhaustive, <i>SYCO</i> welcomes
      submissions with a compositional focus related to any of the following
      areas, in particular from the perspective of category theory:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>logical methods in computer science</b>, including classical and
        quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language
        processing and machine learning;</li>
      <li><b>graphical calculi</b>, including string diagrams, Petri nets and
        reaction networks;</li>
      <li><b>languages and frameworks</b>, including process algebras, proof

Finite model theory plays a crucial role in the development of this approach to complexity. Categorical logic is a vast generalization of model theory which includes, among many other things, finite model theory. In this talk, we will see how the ideas of descriptive complexity may be used in the context of categorical logic to give interesting characterizations of a number of standard complexity classes.</div></div></td></tr>

We give yet another characterization, which is very succinct: finiteness-preserving functors from the category of semigroups to itself, together with a certain output function that is a natural transformation. Semigroups are like monoids, but possibly without a unit element. Our result is analogous to the following classical theorem: a set of words over a finite alphabet, in other words a function from a finitely generated free monoid to {yes,no}, is a regular language – described by some regular expression, or equivalently recognized by some finite-state automaton – if and only if it factors through a homomorphism to a finite semigroup. Or to a finite monoid, but for our generalization to string-to-string functions, there are good technical reasons to work with semigroups instead.</div></div></td></tr>

Graded of-course, which captures how many times a proposition is used, has an analogous interpretation to that of the of-course modality from linear logic; the ofcourse modality from linear logic can be modelled by a linear exponential comonad and the graded of-course can be modelled by a graded linear exponential comonad. Benton showed in his seminal paper on Linear/Non-Linear logic and models that the of-course modality can be split into two modalities connecting intuitionistic logic with linear logic forming a symmetric monoidal adjunction. Later, Katsumata demonstrated that every graded comonad can be decomposed into an adjunction. We give a similar result to Benton’s, showing that graded modalities can be split into two modalities connecting a graded logic with linear logic. We propose a sequent calculus, its proof theory and categorical model, and a natural deduction system.</div></div></td></tr>

The result is a double monoid with a lax interchange law between concatenation (i.e. serial composition) and parallel composition.  Its free models are series-parallel pomsets, that is, partial strings which a freely generated from the alphabet by binary serial and parallel composition. We have recently had occasion to consider a generalisation of serial composition where events in pomsets may continue across compositions.  The resulting algebraic structure is a 2-category with a form of lax tensor; for the time being it is not clear what are its free models, nor whether they even exist.  Further, ultimately we is interested in languages of pomsets, and lifting 2-categories (or just categories) across the powerset functor has turned out to be interesting just in and of itself.</div></div></td></tr>

A striking feature of quantum theory is that those probability distributions obtained in quantum mechanical experiments do not always admit a joint probability distribution, a celebrated observation due to Bell. Such distributions are called contextual. Simplicial distributions are combinatorial models that extend presheaves of probability distributions by elevating sets of measurements and outcomes to spaces. Contextuality can be defined in this generalized setting. This paper introduces the notion of convex categories to study simplicial distributions from a categorical perspective. Simplicial distributions can be given the structure of a convex monoid, a convex category with a single object, when the outcome space has the structure of a group. We describe contextuality as a monoid-theoretic notion by introducing a weak version of invertibility for monoids. Our main result is that a simplicial distribution is noncontextual if and only if it is weakly invertible. Similarly, strong contextuality and contextual fraction can be characterized in terms of invertibility in monoids.</div></div></td></tr>

This vein still has plenty of ideas to mine, of which I shall present one originally suggested to me by the late Pieter Hofstra: the correspondence between closed subgroups of the (topological) automorphism group of a set and extensions of that set by relations.

Unfortunately, this theory excludes many modern semantic models in which the associativity and unit laws only hold up to coherent isomorphism: for instance, because composition is defined using a universal property. This work remedies the situation. We define premonoidal bicategories and a notion of strength for pseudomonads, and show that the Kleisli bicategory of a strong pseudomonad is premonoidal. As often in 2-dimensional category theory, the main difficulty is to find the correct coherence axioms on 2-cells. We therefore justify our definitions with numerous examples and by proving a correspondence theorem between actions and strengths, generalizing a well-known result.</div></div></td></tr>

We define a double category of enriched categories, enriched functors, and enriched cofunctors, whose horizontal and vertical 2-categories have 2-cells given by enriched natural transformations between functors and cofunctors, respectively. Enriched lenses are defined as a compatible enriched functor and enriched cofunctor pair; weighted lenses, which were introduced by Perrone, are precisely lenses enriched in weighted sets.

We attempt to generalize both to higher functors, in particular 2-functors between bicategories. This necessitates a notion of lax trifunctor, which is problematic since the notion found in the existing literature on tricategories is not well-defined in full generality. Constructing such a notion is work in progress. Our approach is to reverse-engineer a definition of lax trifunctor from the setting of opetopic higher categories, where there is a canonical notion of lax functor. Further goals include directly classifying opetopic functors, among others.</div></div></td></tr>

Parameterised quantum circuits may do so to lesser or greater extents, depending upon the values of the parameters. One may sample the parameters of such a circuit – evaluating its possible outcome states for all the various input parameter states. This is a general-purpose procedure for enumerating parameterised graphs for various (or all) choices of free parameters, with applications in circuit simplification, computing scalars, and in some circuit compilation tasks. The most straightforward method of achieving such parameter sampling is essentially to brute force every possible state of the circuit (that is to say, try every combination of parameter values). However, the runtime of this approach scales exponentially with the number of parameters in the circuit and becomes impractically slow for circuits of more than a few such parameters. In this paper, a new method of parameter sampling is introduced that achieves this same goal in a manner that (for most cases) scales linearly with the number of parameters. For typical circuits, this reduces the infeasible runtimes down to just seconds or even milliseconds.</div></div></td></tr>

Furthermore, it is a complete graphical rewrite system: any equation involving linear maps that is derivable in the Hilbert space formalism for quantum theory can also be derived in the calculus by rewriting. It has widespread usage within quantum industry and academia for a variety of tasks such as quantum circuit optimisation, error-correction, and education. The ZW-calculus is an alternative universal graphical language that is also complete for qubit quantum computing. In fact, its completeness was used to prove that the ZX-calculus is universally complete. This calculus has advanced how quantum circuits are compiled into photonic hardware architectures in the industry. Recently, by combining these two calculi, a new calculus has emerged for qubit quantum computation, the ZXW-calculus. Using this calculus, graphical-differentiation, -integration, and -exponentiation were made possible, thus enabling the development of novel techniques in the domains of quantum machine learning and quantum chemistry. Here, we generalise the ZXW-calculus to arbitrary finite dimensions, that is, to qudits. Moreover, we prove that this graphical rewrite system is complete for any finite dimension. This is the first completeness result for any universal graphical language beyond qubits.</div></div></td></tr>

      The symposium will be held
      in <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">École Polytechnique</a>, which
      is located in Palaiseau (France). It is near Paris in the southern area
      and there are very frequent trains between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      More precisely, the talks will take place in the <em>Sophie Germain</em>
      amphitheater of the <em>computer science lab</em> (<em>laboratoire
      d'informatique</em> in French) which is located in the <em>Turing
      building</em> of École Polytechnique (1 Rue Honoré d'Estienne d'Orves
      91120 Palaiseau):

    <p>
      There is a high-speed train (TGV) station in Massy-Palaiseau
        (called <em>Massy TGV</em>), and it can be much faster and simpler going
        directly there than going through Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to come from Paris, you should take RER B (or RER C) train line
      (see <a href="https://www.ratp.fr/en/">RATP</a> for schedules) and stop
      either at
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Massy-Palaiseau</em> and then take 91.06 or 91.10 bus and stop
        at <em>Place Mareguerite Perey</em></li>
      <li><em>Lozère</em> and then walk through the pedestrian path and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/toUgZtfr7fMujvSp7">the stairs</a> (around 15 minutes)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The travel takes roughly 30 minutes from Paris to Massy, and 20 minutes
      from Massy to École Polytechnique.
    </p>

    <p>
      We recommend that you take a hotel
      in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/eUS6UTU8xn2FotJZ7">Massy</a>, and come at
      École Polytechnique using the 91.06 or 91.10 bus from the train station
      (see above). Lodging in Paris is also possible, although expected to be
      more expensive. Here are some suggestions for hotels in Massy:

    <h2 id="deferral">Deferral</h2>
    <p>
      The intention is for <i>SYCO</i> to be a community meeting, where people
      have enough time to explain their ideas, and with a friendly and
      non-competitive atmosphere. To encourage this, in the event that more
      submissions are received of an acceptable standard than can be
      accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose
      to <i>defer</i> some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject
      them. This would be done based largely on submission order, giving an
      incentive for early submission, but would also take into account other
      requirements, such as ensuring a broad and inclusive scientific
      programme. The perceived strength of the submission as judged by the
      reviewers is <i>not</i> taken into account for a deferral decision, so a
      deferral is not in any sense a rejection. Deferred submissions can then be
      re-submitted to any future <i>SYCO</i> meeting, where they will be
      prioritised for inclusion in the programme, and where they will not need
      to be re-reviewed. Meetings are held sufficiently frequently to avoid a
      backlog of deferred papers.
    </p>

    <h2 id="submissions">Submissions</h2>
    <p>
      Submissions are by OpenReview, via
      the <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=cl.cam.ac.uk/SYCO/2023/Symposium">SYCO
      11 submission page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Submissions should present research results in sufficient detail to allow
      them to be properly considered by members of the programme committee, who
      will assess their interest to the <i>SYCO</i> community. We encourage the
      submission of work in progress, as well as mature results. There are no
      proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been previously
      published, or has been submitted for consideration elsewhere. There is no
      specific formatting requirement, and no page limit, although for long
      submissions authors should be aware that reviewers will not be able to
      read the entire document in detail. Think creatively: you could submit a
      recent paper, draft notes of a project in progress, or even a recent
      Masters or PhD thesis. Speakers are expected to present their contribution
      in person, and submissions must point out who will present the
      contribution if it is selected.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous <i>SYCO</i>
      meeting, it will not automatically be considered for this event; if you
      would like to present it, you must submit it again through EasyChair. Such
      a submission will be prioritised for inclusion in the scientific
      programme. When submitting, append the words "DEFERRED FROM SYCO X" to the
      title of your paper, replacing "X" with the appropriate meeting
      number. There is no need to attach any documents.
