CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS
ELEVENTH SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 11)

Palaiseau, France
20-21 April, 2023

Submission deadline: Monday 6 March 2023
https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/11/
-----------------------------------------

The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an interdisciplinary series
of meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers interested in
the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives,
and in particular where category theory serves as a unifying common
language. Previous SYCO events have been held in Birmingham, Strathclyde,
Oxford, Chapman, Leicester, Tallinn, and Como.

We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics,
physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly discussion,
disseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge between fields. Submission is
encouraged for both mature research and work in progress, and by both
established academics and junior researchers, including students. Submissions is
easy, with no formatting or page restrictions. The meeting does not have
proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published
elsewhere. You could submit work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or
even a PhD or Masters thesis.

While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions with a
compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in particular from
the perspective of category theory:

- logical methods in computer science, including classical and quantum
  programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language processing and machine
  learning;
- graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and reaction
  networks;
- languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets, type theory
  and game semantics;
- abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal category theory,
  higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and relationships to homotopy
  theory;
- quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation theory;
- tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof assistants,
  and game theory;
- industrial applications, including case studies and real-world problem
  descriptions.

IMPORTANT DATES
===============

All deadlines are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth.

Submission deadline: Monday 6 March, 2023
Author notification: Sunday 20 March, 2023
Symposium dates: Thursday 20 and Friday 21 April 2023

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

Submissions are by OpenReview, via the SYCO 11 submission page:
https://openreview.net/group?id=cl.cam.ac.uk/SYCO/2023/Symposium

Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions. The
meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been
submitted or published elsewhere. Think creatively: you could submit a recent
paper, or notes on work in progress, or even a recent Masters or PhD thesis.

In the event that more good-quality submissions are received than can be
accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose to *defer*
some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject them. Deferred
submissions can be re-submitted to any future SYCO meeting, where they will not
need peer review, and where they will be prioritised for inclusion in the
programme. Meetings will be held sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of
deferred papers.

If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous SYCO meeting, it
will not automatically be considered for SYCO 11; you still need to submit it
again through OpenReview. When submitting, append the words "DEFERRED FROM SYCO
X" to the title of your paper, replacing "X" with the appropriate meeting
number. There is no need to attach any documents.

PROGRAMME COMMITTEE
===================

The PC chair is Bryce Clarke, Inria Saclay. The Programme Committee will
