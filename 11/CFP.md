CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS
ELEVENTH SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 10)

Edinburgh, United Kingdom
19-20 December, 2022

Submission deadline:  Monday 7 November 2022
https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/10/
-----------------------------------------

The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an interdisciplinary
series of meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers
interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and
abstract perspectives, and in particular where category theory serves as a
unifying common language. Previous SYCO events have been held in
Birmingham, Strathclyde, Oxford, Chapman, Leicester, Tallinn, and Como.

We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science,
mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of
fostering friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading
knowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature
research and work in progress, and by both established academics and
junior researchers, including students. Submissions is easy, with no
formatting or page restrictions. The meeting does not have proceedings, so
work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published elsewhere.
You could submit work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or even a
PhD or Masters thesis.

While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions
with a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in
particular from the perspective of category theory:

- logical methods in computer science, including classical and
quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language
processing and machine learning;
- graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and
reaction networks;
- languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets,
type theory and game semantics;
- abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal
category theory, higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and
relationships to homotopy theory;
- quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation
theory;
- tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof
assistants, and game theory;
- industrial applications, including case studies and real-world
problem descriptions.

** IMPORTANT DATES **

All deadlines are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth.

Submission deadline: Monday 7 November, 2022
Author notification: Sunday 20 November, 2022
Symposium dates: Monday 19 and Tuesday 20 December 2022

** SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS **

Submissions are by OpenReview, via the SYCO 10 submission page:
https://openreview.net/group?id=cl.cam.ac.uk/SYCO/2022/Symposium

Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions.
The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even
if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. Think creatively:
you could submit a recent paper, or notes on work in progress, or even
a recent Masters or PhD thesis.

In the event that more good-quality submissions are received than can
be accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose
to *defer* some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject
them. Deferred submissions can be re-submitted to any future SYCO
meeting, where they will not need peer review, and where they will be
prioritised for inclusion in the programme. Meetings will be held
sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.

If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous SYCO
meeting, it will not automatically be considered for SYCO 10; you still
need to submit it again through OpenReview. When submitting, append the
words "DEFERRED FROM SYCO X" to the title of your paper, replacing "X"
with the appropriate meeting number. There is no need to attach any
documents.

** PROGRAMME COMMITTEE **

The PC chair is Robin Kaarsgaard, University of Edinburgh. The Programme
Committee will be announced soon.
