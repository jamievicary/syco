We explain this framework and illustrate it with the example of stock-flow diagrams.  These diagrams are widely used in epidemiology to model the dynamics of populations. Although tools already exist for building these diagrams and simulating the models they describe, we have created a software package called StockFlow which uses decorated cospans to overcome some limitations of existing software.  Our approach enables the composition of stock-flow diagrams, and cleanly separates their syntax from the semantics they can be assigned.  We have implemented three forms of semantics, including one where stock-flow diagrams are mapped to ordinary differential equations.  We have also created a web-based graphical user interface for StockFlow that requires no knowledge of category theory or programming to use.  This is joint work with Xiaoyan Li, Sophie Libkind, Nathaniel Osgood, Evan Patterson, Long Pham and Eric Redekopp.</div></div></td>

A typical model is a collection of simple graphs sharing the same set of vertices: the vertices represent individual actors in the system, and each graph a distinct relation among them. The collection of graphs, taken together, is referred to as a multi-relational network. There are various well established methods of extracting information about the structure of a social system from such a model. For instance, to study the ‘social roles’ present in a system, one studies the semigroup generated under composition of relations. This procedure is known as role analysis.</p><p>Often, however, graphs—which record only pairwise connections between actors—are not sufficient to describe a system faithfully. Increasingly researchers prefer to make use of hypergraphs or simplicial complexes, which can incorporate ties of higher dimension. The question arises: what is a ‘social role’ in such a system? The effort to lift role analysis fom graphs to higher-dimensional models requires us to consider what it means to ‘compose’ two hypergraphs and leads us, somewhat unexpectedly, into the realm of universal coalgebra.</p><p>This is work in progress, joint with Daniel Cicala, Rachel Hardeman Morrill, Abby Hickok, Nikola Milećević, Nima Motamed and Nina Otter.</p></div></div></td>

      <td><div class="talk">11:15–11:40 Clémence Chanavat:<br> <i>Cubical Type Theory Inside a Presheaf Topos</i><div class="abstract">The need for a cubical type theory, rather than, say, a simplicial one, comes from the lack of computational content the latter provides. In cubical settings, we can compute the univalence axiom. However, the drawback comes from the syntax of the cubical type theory which tends to be technical. From the semantic point of view, there is not one good category of cubes, there are a lot of variations, each of them with specific features.      Our main goal is to focus on one specific cube category and to prove that it is indeed a model of this specific cubical type theory. To do this we rely on the work of Orton and Pitts who showed how the data of a topos, a interval object and a class of cofibrations satisfying a list of nine axioms suffices to model cubical type theory, providing a nice and clean axiomatic framework.      However, in this new setting, new challenges appear. We need to answer the question of what it means for an axiom to be true in a topos. Classical work from McLane and Moerdijk or Lambek and Scott showed how it is possible to compute the internal logic of a topos using the notion of Kripke-Joyal semantics and forcing. Still, this approach does not take into account the modern needs of type theory, like proof relevance. Thus, Awodey, Gambino, and Hazratpour proposed a new version of Kripke-Joyal semantics. Their setting is a particular case of a topos, namely a presheaf category. There, they interpret Martin-Lof type theory thanks to the notion of category with families and extend the notion of forcing to this more general case.       Hence, we apply their results to the case of the presheaf category over the category of cubes, and show that Kripke-Joyal forcing helps us to check the validity of the nine axioms. Our work gives a new perspective on the work of Orton and Pitts by using the recent tools of Awodey, Gambino, and Hazratpour to check the internal validity of the axioms. This provides a more systematic approach that could be generalized to various presheaf toposes. </div></div></td>

In this talk I consider morphisms of generic arity and present an axiomatic definition of higher-arity category based on hypergraph rewrite systems generalizing the usual binary composition of morphisms. This will be done via the unifying 'Principle of Hypergraph Simplicity', that will allow to regard many structures (semicategories, daggers, categorical products, operads...) as slight variations of hypergraph rewrite systems.  Our discussion will be motivated by the investigation of certain higher-order matrix alegebras that generalize relational algebras and tensor networks. In particular, the definition of higher-arity category will be directly inspired by the example of a heapoid, a kind of (partial) ternary algebra satisfying a generalized version of associativity recently found by the author in the context of ternary matrix algebra.  This research fits into the larger project of <a href="https://arity.science">Arity Science</a>, a project lead by the author that seeks to develop mathematical formalisms that are well-adapted to describe higher-order compositional phenomena across formal and natural sciences.</div></div></td>
      <td><div class="talk">11:40-12:05 Louis Lemonnier:<br> <i>Central Submonads and Notions of Computation</i><div class="abstract">The notion of "centre" has been introduced for many algebraic structures in mathematics. A notable example is the centre of a monoid which always determines a commutative submonoid.  Monads (in category theory) can be seen as generalisations of monoids and in this paper we show how the notion of centre may be extended to strong monads acting on symmetric monoidal categories.  We show that the centre of a strong monad $\mathcal T$, if it exists, determines a commutative submonad $\mathcal Z$ of $\mathcal T$, such Kleisli category of $\mathcal T$. We provide three equivalent conditions which characterise the existence of the centre of $\mathcal T$. While not every strong monad admits a centre, we show that every strong monad on well-known naturally occurring categories does admit a centre, thereby showing that this new notion is ubiquitous. We also provide a computational interpretation of our ideas which consists in giving a refinement of Moggi's monadic metalanguage. The added benefit is that this allows us to immediately establish a large class of contextually equivalent terms for monads that admit a non-trivial centre by simply looking at the richer syntactic structure provided by the refinement.</div></div></td>

In this talk we present a definition for infinity-categories with strict associators, but which is otherwise fully weak. Our approach is based on the existing type theory Catt, whose models are known to correspond to weak infinity-categories. We add a definitional equality relation to this theory which identifies terms with the same associativity structure, yielding a new type theory Cattsa, for strictly associative infinity-categories. We also provide a reduction relation which generates definitional equality, and show it is confluent and terminating, giving an algorithm for deciding equality of terms, and making typechecking decidable.  Our key contribution, on which our reduction is based, is an operation on terms which we call insertion. This has a direct geometrical interpretation, allowing a subterm to be inserted into the head of the term, flatting its syntactic structure. We describe this operation combinatorially in terms of pasting diagrams, and also show can be characterized as a pushout of contexts. This allows reasoning about insertion using just its universal property. </div></div></td>

However, only a few consider both higher-order languages and syntactic calculation of weakest precondition transformers. In this paper, we consider weakest precondition transformers for a higher-order functional language with computational effects and recursions and show that we can calculate them via a CPS transformation. We prove this in a general framework of categorical semantics. Because of this generality, two existing methods for program verification can be understood as instances of our result.</div></div></td>

      <td><div class="talk">12:35-13:00 Edward Morehouse:<br> <i>Locally Cubical Gray-Categories</i><div class="abstract">We present locally cubical Gray-categories, the cubical analogue of classical, locally globular, Gray-categories. In the same way that Gray-categories present the structure of 2-dimensional globular categories (2-categories or bicategories) together with their hierarchy of morphisms (functors, transformations, and modifications), locally cubical Gray-categories present the structure of 2-dimensional cubical categories (strict or weak double categories) together with their hierarchy of morphisms.  In the globular case, 2-categories may have transformations of several possible variances, but in only one dimension. In contrast, double categories have transformations in two independent dimensions, reflecting the two types of morphisms within double categories themselves. In locally cubical Gray-categories this gives rise to four distinct types of interchanger, which we can think of as vertical-vertical, vertical-horizontal, horizontal-vertical, and horizontal-horizontal, where we have a choice of variance in each dimension independently. The homogeneous interchangers behave like the globular interchangers of classical Gray-categories, while the heterogeneous ones give rise to non-globular natural squares. This determines a family of 3-dimensional structures, which are cubical in two dimensions and globular in the third.  An algebraic presentation of locally cubical Gray-categories by generators and relations is rather complex. One reason for this is the infelicity of encoding an inherently 3-dimensional theory using a 1-dimensional notation. Fortunately, the geometric intuition behind the algebra is simple and compelling. By using a 3-dimensional language we are able to represent and reason about terms of locally cubical Gray-categories in a natural and intuitive manner.</div></div></td>

Simultaneously, there has been intense interest in the effect of measurements on the dynamics of quantum information in many-body systems.

Structured decompositions allow us to generalize combinatorial invariants to new settings (for example decompositions of matroids) in which they describe algorithmically useful structural compositionality. As an application of our theory we prove an algorithmic meta theorem for the Sub_P-composition problem which, when instantiated in the category of graphs, yields compositional algorithms for NP-hard problems such as: Maximum Bipartite Subgraph, Maximum Planar Subgraph and Longest Path. </div></div></td>
      <td><div class="talk">13:55-14:20 Leo Lobski: <br><i>Quantum quirks, classical contexts</i><div class="abstract">Two results of the following general form are proved: a functor from a category of algebras to the category of posets is essentially injective on objects above a certain size. The first result is for Boolean algebras and the functor taking each Boolean algebra to its poset of finite subalgebras. This strengthens and provides a novel proof for a result by Sachs, Filippov and Gr√§tzer, Koh & Makkai. The second result is for finite MV-algebras and the functor taking each such algebra to its poset of partitions of unity.  The second result uses the dual equivalence of finite MV-algebras with finite multisets, as well as the correspondence between partition posets of finite multisets and setoid quotients. Thus the equivalence is constructed via the powerset functor for multisets, and setoid quotients are introduced. The equivalence is a special case of a more general duality proved by Cignoli, Dubuc and Mundici.  The primary interest of this work lies in algebras describing quantum observables, hence both results are viewed as statements about effect algebras. Since MV-algebras contain "unsharp" (i.e. self-orthogonal) elements, the second result shows that sharpness is not a necessary condition for essential injectivity of the partitions of unity functor. Physically, this means that there are systems with unsharp effects (namely, those represented by finite MV-algebras) which can be faithfully reconstructed from all the possible measurements.</div></div></td>

This problem is a crucial step in any algorithm which uses the divide and conquer method to find shortest paths. This extended abstract details how this problem may be understood categorically. Finding shortest paths is represented by a functor and the composition problem asks to find the value of this functor on a pushout using the values of the functor on the components. Furthermore, we present an algorithm which solves the composition problem for shortest paths. When implemented in Python, this algorithm reduces the computation time for finding shortest paths by relying on precompilation.</div></div></td>

We also characterize the positivity of representable Markov categories and prove that causality implies positivity, but not conversely.

We show that this construction allows us to treat the adjacency matrix of a GCNN as a parameter; a global parameter, instead of a a locally, layer-wise parameter. This gives us a high-level categorical characterisation of a particular kind of inductive bias GCNNs posses. Lastly, we hypothesize about possible generalisations of GCNNs to general message-passing graph neural networks, connections to equivariant learning, and the (lack of) functoriality of activation functions. </div></div></td>

And, if you think about monoids at all, you noted that it applies in a limited way to monoids. The  notion of a Cayley monoid is just an internalization of this type of representation. There are many examples of Cayley monoids. Some of these are obtained from the group of a monoid acting on the monoid itself. There are some interesting special cases of Cayley monoids with strong <_{L} commutativity properties . An example is provided by the monoid Z*Q where Q is the quaternion group. In these cases we say that the Cayley monoid has an autonomous commutator.  Here will will show that every monoid can be extended to a Cayley monoid with an autonomous commutator. </div></div></td>

Although the combinatorics of Hipparchus' calculations is now well-understood, the logical interpretation is less so.  Suzanne Bobzien makes a convincing case that his calculations were based on underlying conceptual errors; as part of this, propositions that should have been identified were instead counted separately.  In particular, propositions arising via different (partial or total) bracketings of the same elementary propositions were considered as distinct.  This is nevertheless familiar from modern categorical logic; we are often forced to use `identical up to unique natural isomorphism' instead of some strict notion of equality.   A fun question (albeit with no historical justification whatsoever) is to consider what kinds of mathematical models would be required if the propositions that Bobzien claims as incorrectly counted separately were indeed related in this way? We give a system that does precisely this.    The result is `freely generated' in the operadic sense, \& may be used to label arbitrary facets of Stasheff's associahedra with functors corresponding to partial or total bracketings. We also exhibit natural transformations between them that live in a posetal category,  and are therefore unique.  This gives a range of diagrams, based on Associahedra, guaranteed to commute (including, of course, MacLane's pentagon as a very special case).  The components of these natural transformations are the `congruential functions' of John Conway; we point out several natural combinatorial/number-theoretic topics that may therefore be interpreted as questions of coherence. </div></div></div></td>

They can be seen as a generalization of atomic flows on one side and of combinatorial proofs on the other side. From atomic flows, introduced by Guglielmi and Gundersen, they inherit the close correspondence with deep inference and the possibility of tracing the occurrences of atoms in a derivation. From combinatorial proofs, introduced by Hughes, they inherit the correctness criterion that allows reconstruction of the derivation from the flow. In fact, combinatorial flows form a proof system in the sense of Cook and Reckhow. We show how to translate between deep inference derivations and combinatorial flows. Moreover, we present the normalization steps for combinatorial flows. We also talk about the termination of these rewriting steps. </div></div></td>    </tr>

<a href="http://edinburgh.org">Edinburgh</a> is Scotland's capital city, renowned for its heritage, culture, and <a href="http://www.eif.co.uk">festivals</a>. Next to the <a href="http://www.ewht.org.uk/highlights-of-the-world-heritage-site">World Heritage Site</a> that is its historic centre, it is the home of many <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/baked/mathmap.jpg">mathematical achievements</a>, world-class <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk">universities</a>, and the backdrop to several famous <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951">movies</a>.
Easy access to beautiful <a href="http://www.visitscotland.com">Scotland</a> makes Edinburgh the second most popular tourist destination in the UK.
</p>

<p>Getting to Edinburgh is easy, through its <a href="http://edinburgh.org/travel/getting-here">international airport</a> and two major railway stations. Most of the centre is easy to navigate on foot, and for longer distances you can <a href="http://edinburgh.org/travel/getting-around">get around</a> by <a href="https://www.icms.org.uk/find-us">bus</a> (carry exact fare), <a href="http://edinburghtrams.com">tram</a>, taxi, <a href="http://www.uber.com/en-GB/cities/edinburgh">uber</a>, or bicycle.</p>

<h2 id="deferral">Deferral</h2>

<p>The intention is for <i>SYCO</i> to be a community meeting, where people have enough time to explain their ideas, and with a friendly and non-competitive atmosphere. To encourage this, in the event that more submissions are received of an acceptable standard than can be accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose to <i>defer</i> some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject them. This would be done based largely on submission order, giving an incentive for early submission, but would also take into account other requirements, such as ensuring a broad and inclusive scientific programme. The perceived strength of the submission as judged by the reviewers is <i>not</i> taken into account for a deferral decision, so a deferral is not in any sense a rejection. Deferred submissions can then be re-submitted to any future <i>SYCO</i> meeting, where they will be prioritised for inclusion in the programme, and where they will not need to be re-reviewed. Meetings are held sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.</p>

<h2 id="submissions">Submissions</h2>

<p>
Submissions are by OpenReview, via the SYCO 10
<a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=cl.cam.ac.uk/SYCO/2022/Symposium">submission page</a>.
</p>

<p>Submissions should present research results in sufficient detail to allow them to be properly considered by members of the programme committee, who will assess their interest to the <i>SYCO</i> community. We encourage the submission of work in progress, as well as mature results. There are no proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been previously published, or has been submitted for consideration elsewhere. There is no specific formatting requirement, and no page limit, although for long submissions authors should be aware that reviewers will not be able to read the entire document in detail. Think creatively&mdash;you could submit a recent paper, draft notes of a project in progress, or even a recent Masters or PhD thesis. Speakers are expected to present their contribution in person, and submissions must point out who will present the contribution if it is selected.</p>

<p>If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous <i>SYCO</i> meeting, it will not automatically be considered for this event; if you would like to present it, you must submit it again through EasyChair. Such a submission will be prioritised for inclusion in the scientific programme. When submitting, append the words "DEFERRED FROM SYCO X" to the title of your paper, replacing "X" with the appropriate meeting number. There is no need to attach any documents.</p>
