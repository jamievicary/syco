     <p>The <i>Symposium on Compositional Structures</i> is a series of interdisciplinary meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers interested in the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives, and in particular where category theory serves as a unifying common language. We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics, physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly discussion, disseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge between fields. Submission is encouraged for both mature research and work in progress, and by both established academics and junior researchers, including students.</p>

     <p>Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions. The meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published elsewhere. You could submit work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or even a PhD or Masters thesis.</p>

     <p>While no list of topics could be exhaustive, <i>SYCO</i> welcomes submissions with a compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in particular from the perspective of category theory:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><b>logical methods in computer science</b>, including classical and quantum programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language processing and machine learning;</li>
      <li><b>graphical calculi</b>, including string diagrams, Petri nets and reaction networks;</li>
      <li><b>languages and frameworks</b>, including process algebras, proof nets, type theory and game semantics;</li>
      <li><b>abstract algebra and pure category theory</b>, including monoidal category theory, higher category theory,
      operads, polygraphs, and relationships to homotopy theory;</li>
      <li><b>quantum algebra</b>, including quantum computation and representation theory;</li>
      <li><b>tools and techniques</b>, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof assistants, and game theory;</li>
      <li><b>industrial applications</b>, including case studies and real-world problem descriptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This new series aims to bring together the communities behind many previous successful events which have taken place
      over the last decade, including

<a href="http://edinburgh.org">Edinburgh</a> is Scotland's capital city, renowned for its heritage, culture, and <a href="http://www.eif.co.uk">festivals</a>. Next to the <a href="http://www.ewht.org.uk/highlights-of-the-world-heritage-site">World Heritage Site</a> that is its historic centre, it is the home of many <a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/baked/mathmap.jpg">mathematical achievements</a>, world-class <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk">universities</a>, and the backdrop to several famous <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951">movies</a>.
Easy access to beautiful <a href="http://www.visitscotland.com">Scotland</a> makes Edinburgh the second most popular tourist destination in the UK.
</p>

<p>Getting to Edinburgh is easy, through its <a href="http://edinburgh.org/travel/getting-here">international airport</a> and two major railway stations. Most of the centre is easy to navigate on foot, and for longer distances you can <a href="http://edinburgh.org/travel/getting-around">get around</a> by <a href="https://www.icms.org.uk/find-us">bus</a> (carry exact fare), <a href="http://edinburghtrams.com">tram</a>, taxi, <a href="http://www.uber.com/en-GB/cities/edinburgh">uber</a>, or bicycle.</p>

<p>Here is a useful list of <a href="https://www.icms.org.uk/local-accommodation">accommodation</a> providers with locations close to the conference venue, that you can book yourself.</p>

<p>Lunches and tea breaks are catered. For dinner, here is a map with some suggestions close to the conference venue, but there are many more, in Old Town, New Town, Newington, Bruntsfield, or the West End, all within walking distance of the conference venue:</p>

It will be possible to follow all talks online. Registered online participants will be contacted by e-mail, closer to the meeting date, with the virtual coordinates.

<h2 id="deferral">Deferral</h2>

<p>The intention is for <i>SYCO</i> to be a community meeting, where people have enough time to explain their ideas, and with a friendly and non-competitive atmosphere. To encourage this, in the event that more submissions are received of an acceptable standard than can be accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose to <i>defer</i> some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject them. This would be done based largely on submission order, giving an incentive for early submission, but would also take into account other requirements, such as ensuring a broad and inclusive scientific programme. Deferred submissions can then be re-submitted to any future <i>SYCO</i> meeting, where they will be prioritised for inclusion in the programme, and where they will not need to be re-reviewed. Meetings are held sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of deferred papers.</p>

<h2 id="submissions">Submissions</h2>

<p>Submissions will be by EasyChair. Submission is not yet open.</p>

<p>Submissions should present research results in sufficient detail to allow them to be properly considered by members of the programme committee, who will assess their interest to the <i>SYCO</i> community. We encourage the submission of work in progress, as well as mature results. There are no proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been previously published, or has been submitted for consideration elsewhere. There is no specific formatting requirement, and no page limit, although for long submissions authors should be aware that reviewers will not be able to read the entire document in detail. Think creatively&mdash;you could submit a recent paper, draft notes of a project in progress, or even a recent Masters or PhD thesis.</p>

<p>If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous <i>SYCO</i> meeting, it will not automatically be considered for this event; if you would like to present it, you must submit it again through EasyChair. Such a submission will be prioritised for inclusion in the scientific programme. When submitting, append the words "DEFERRED FROM SYCO X" to the title of your paper, replacing "X" with the appropriate meeting number. There is no need to attach any documents.</p>
